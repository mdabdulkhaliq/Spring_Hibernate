Spring Core Notes:
------------------
Add Spring distribution jars to the classpath
Add commons logging jar to the classpath

Dependency injection is to remove or decouple object dependencies from each other.
BeanFactory is an interface
XMLBeanFactory is the implementation for the BeanFactory interface which takes XML file as an input to lookup for beans.
Pass a FileSystemResource("spring.xml") to the XMLBeanFactory.
Create the spring.xml , add the XML tag and DTD for beans.
Create a beans tag and add bean definitions to the xml
Bean will have an id and class attributes
The bean tag definition is blue print of the object
use factory.getBean(idFromXML) will return the object of that bean, save it to the corresponding Type
We can then call methods from that class.
The BeanFactory will manage the lifecycle of the objects that will be created.

ApplicationContext is also an interface.
ClassPathXmlApplicationContext is the implementation of Application Context.
Just pass the xml file to ClassPathXmlApplicationContext.
Then just get bean using getBean.
In the Spring.xml, we can write property tag for beans , this will assign values to the class properties after instantiating the objects.
Setter injection: property has name and value attributes.
Constructor injection: If we want to set the property of the class through constructor then  we can do it via constructor-arg and giving its value.
We can have multiple constructor-args tags, and spring will automatically calls the corresponding constructor.
We can specify an type attribute to constructor-args tag. (int, java.lang.String, etc)
We can specify an index attribute to the constructor-args
<bean id="triangle" class="com.abdul.khaliq">
<constructor-args type="int" value="20" /> //If there are two constructors which accept one string and other int, use type to remove the ambiguity.
<property name="" value=""/>
</bean>
Difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContect
Bean Factory:
Bean instantiation/wiring
Application Context:
Bean instantiation/wiring
Automatic BeanPostProcessor registration
Automatic BeanFactoryPostProcessor registration
Convenient MessageSource access (for i18n)
ApplicationEvent publication

If the property of a bean is referring to another object saying Triangle has a Point object reference, then we declare point bean definition first.
then in the triangle  bean definition, we assign the point property to the reference of the point bean.
<bean id="triangle" class="com.oracle.com">
  <property name="pointA" ref="zeroPoint"/>
</bean>

We can also remove the ref of the property and define the bean inside the property tag itself (inner beans) and an id is also not required for the inner bean as it will not or cannot be accessed by other beans.
Using Aliases we can give different names for the same beans.
<alias  name="triangle" alias="triangle-alias"/> (name is the id of the actual bean)
We can use name attribute on the bean this is also another name for the bean. (id, name and alias refer to same  bean)
Better to use ids, as xml validator will catch errors if any duplicates are defined.
ref attribute can point to id, name or alias.
if we want to restrict ref to id's we can use idref property inside property.
<property name="pointA">
<idref="zeroPoint"/>
</property>

We saw assigning objects of other class and primitive types, but We can assign List , set and Map values also to the properties using list and ref tags.
<property name="points">
<list>
<ref bean="point1"/>
<ref bean="point2"/>
<ref bean="point3"/>
</list>
</property>

We can use autowiring by asking the spring framework to intelligently guess the references and assign the properties from the beans available.
Using XMl, we can use autowire attribute to the bean tag and provide value as byName
in this case the properties in the class have same name as that of bean names in xml.
autowire byType will autowire the ONLY bean object available in xml to the property of the bean i.e member of the class.
autowire=constructor will autowire properties by passing available bean types to the constructor .
byType and constructor should have only one beans of that types that we are autowiring , if not ambiguity.

The applicationContext creates beans when its initialized itself i.e when giving the spring.xml file as input.
These beans are then served when a request is received, this is the default behaviour.
Bean scopes: Singleton (one instance is created per spring container)-default behaviour
Prototype: new bean created for every reference or request.

Web aware Context bean scopes:
Request: new bean per servlet request
Session: new bean per session.
Global session: New bean  per global HTTP session.(portlet context)

scope attribute is specified on the bean tag.

To get the springApplicationContext in other classes , those classes need to implement ApplicationContectAware to get hold of the ApplicationContext object for that spring container.
implement BeanNameAware to get the BeanName that is being called/executed.

BeanDefinitionInheritance: We can inherit existing bean definitions to our beans using parent tag on the bean element.
declare parentTriangle bean with only pointA property set.
declare triangle1 bean with parent="parentTriangle" this will have pointA automatically set for triangle1
We can override the pointA or we can use it, and aslo define new properties pointB and pointC
We can also declare parentTriangle as abstract="true" in bean tag
if parentTriangle has a list property, and triangle1 uses parent, so when triangle1 defines list property it  overrides the values
but if we want to merge we can say merge="true" on the list tag
<property name="points">
<list merge="true">
<ref bean="pointB"/>
</list>
</property>

We need to close the applicationContext for desktop/SE applications. But for web applications the container takes care of it.
to close application contect we need to use AbstractApplicationContext and not ApplicationContext
Then call abstractApplicationContext.registerShutdownHook();
When the main method ends, the application context is shutdown.

To use init lifecycle methods of a bean, the bean needs to implement InitializingBean. The method afterPropertiesSet is called before the code is executed and after the properties are set on that bean.
To use destroy lifecycle method of a bean, the bean should implement DisposableBean, the destroy method is called before the bean is destroyed.

Instead of implementing the beans for init and destroy, we can just declare methods for init and destory in the bean and specify the configuration in spring.xml
the bean tag in spring.xml has attributes init-method and destory-method which takes method names, this will call init and destory methods for that bean.
